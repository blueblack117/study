Heat management is a major issue in complex electronic devices and affects powerful computer systems in various ways.[55] The thermal design power and CPU power dissipation issues in supercomputing surpass those of traditional computer cooling technologies. The supercomputing awards for green computing reflect this issue.[56][57][58]

The packing of thousands of processors together inevitably generates significant amounts of heat density that need to be dealt with. The Cray 2 was liquid cooled, and used a Fluorinert "cooling waterfall" which was forced through the modules under pressure.[36] However, the submerged liquid cooling approach was not practical for the multi-cabinet systems based on off-the-shelf processors, and in System X a special cooling system that combined air conditioning with liquid cooling was developed in conjunction with the Liebert company.[37]

In the Blue Gene system, IBM deliberately used low power processors to deal with heat density.[59] The IBM Power 775, released in 2011, has closely packed elements that require water cooling.[60] The IBM Aquasar system uses hot water cooling to achieve energy efficiency, the water being used to heat buildings as well.[61][62]

The energy efficiency of computer systems is generally measured in terms of "FLOPS per watt". In 2008, IBM's Roadrunner operated at 3.76 MFLOPS/W.[63][64] In November 2010, the Blue Gene/Q reached 1,684 MFLOPS/W.[65][66] In June 2011 the top 2 spots on the Green 500 list were occupied by Blue Gene machines in New York (one achieving 2097 MFLOPS/W) with the DEGIMA cluster in Nagasaki placing third with 1375 MFLOPS/W.[67]
